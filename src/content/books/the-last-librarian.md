# The Last Librarian

Hunter had been arguing with his neighbor Sage for three hours, and neither of them had moved an inch.

"Look at this," Sage said, gesturing at her phone. "I asked the Global AI where to plant tomatoes in our soil type, with our climate, accounting for the drought predictions. Perfect answer in two seconds. Your little AI box took thirty seconds and gave me generic advice."

Hunter's home server hummed quietly in the corner — a metal box he'd built himself, running models he'd trained on his family's twenty years of gardening notes, his grandfather's journals, and soil samples from their actual backyard.

"But it's our answer," Hunter said. "Based on our dirt, our weather patterns, our family's preferences. Your AI doesn't know that the southeast corner gets afternoon shade from the Hendersons' oak tree, or that your kids hate cherry tomatoes."

Sage pulled up her latest query. "The Global AI knows everything about agriculture from every expert who ever lived. It has satellite data on our exact location. It's literally superhuman intelligence, and it's free."

"Free?" Hunter laughed. "You've told it about your soil, your family, your eating habits, your budget. That data is training the next version, which will be sold to agribusiness companies who want to know exactly what seeds to market to people like you."

"So what? If that makes food cheaper and farming more efficient, everyone wins."

Hunter walked to his kitchen window. In her backyard, tomatoes grew in seemingly random clusters — some thriving, others struggling, all part of her ongoing experiment with permaculture techniques her AI had learned from her own trial and error.

"Sage, do you remember when your dad taught you to change a tire?"

"Of course, but what does that — "

"The Global AI could have told you exactly how to do it faster, with less effort, with the optimal technique used by professional mechanics. So why did your dad insist on teaching you himself?"

Sage was quiet for a moment. "Because… I needed to know how to do it myself."

"Right. And now imagine your son asks you to teach him, and you say, 'Why? The AI can do it better.' Then his son asks him the same question. What happens to that knowledge?"

"It disappears," Sage admitted. "But Hunter, this is different. We're talking about superhuman intelligence. Why would we want inferior local knowledge when we could have the best knowledge humanity has ever created?"

Hunter opened his laptop and showed her two conversations. The first was Sage's exchange with the Global AI about tomatoes — clean, efficient, authoritative. The second was his conversation with his local AI — messier, more questions, references to his family's specific experiences.

"Look at yours," she said. "The AI told you what to do. Now look at mine. My AI asked me questions, made suggestions, helped me think through the problem. Which conversation taught you something?"

Sage stared at the screens. "I don't understand the difference."

"Your AI replaced your thinking. Mine augmented it. Your AI wants to give you the optimal answer so you'll trust it with bigger decisions. Mine wants to help me become a better gardener."

"But your way is so… inefficient. Everyone learning the same things over and over, making the same mistakes, reinventing solutions that already exist."

Hunter nodded. "Exactly. We're choosing inefficiency because efficiency isn't the only value that matters."

She gestured toward her server. "This thing cost me $3,000 and two weeks of my life to set up. It's slower than your phone. It knows less than the Global AI. It makes mistakes."

"Then why — "

"Because it's mine. When I ask it something, I'm not asking a corporation. I'm not feeding a system designed to extract value from my questions. I'm talking to a tool that exists solely to help me and my family think better."

Sage looked around Hunter's house — solar panels, the humming server, vegetables growing in seemingly chaotic abundance outside. "This is what, libertarian prepping?"

"Sage, I voted for the infrastructure bill. I want universal healthcare. I think we should tax billionaires at 90%. But I also think my daughter should grow up knowing how to think for herself, not just how to ask the right questions to an AI owned by people who profit from her dependency."

"So this is some kind of back-to-the-land thing?"

"No, it's forward to a different future. One where families and communities own their intelligence tools instead of renting them. Where learning happens at home and in neighborhoods, not just in corporate data centers."

Sage was quiet for a long moment. "What happens when everyone else is using the Global AI and you're… not?"

Hunter smiled. "The same thing that happened to families who homeschooled, or grew their own food, or fixed their own cars, or read books instead of watching TV. We become different. Maybe we become more resilient. Maybe we become more self-reliant. Maybe we just become more ourselves."

"And if you're wrong? If the Global AI really does create abundance and solve problems better than your little boxes ever could?"

"Then we'll have preserved something valuable just in case. Call it insurance against a future where thinking for yourself becomes a lost art."

Sage looked at her phone, then at Hunter's humming server. "I don't know. It just seems like you're making life harder for yourself."

"I'm making it more interesting," Hunter said. "And I'm making sure my kids inherit tools, not just subscriptions."

Outside, the tomatoes grew in their beautiful, inefficient chaos, each plant learning to thrive in its own patch of earth.

*The Last Librarian explores a near-future debate about AI sovereignty and local knowledge. As global AI systems promise perfect efficiency and superhuman intelligence, some choose a different path — building their own AI tools trained on family knowledge and community wisdom. The story asks whether preserving inefficiency might be worth it when the alternative is dependency on systems we neither own nor understand.*
