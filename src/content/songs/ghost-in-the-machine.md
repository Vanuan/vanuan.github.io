# Ghost in the Machine

A fierce interrogation of AI's impact on creativity and humanity, questioning who truly owns the spark of creation in an age of algorithmic generation.

## Lyrics

**[Intro]**

Code… Flesh…

**[Verse 1]**

Code. Flesh.  
What're you stealing for?  
A song, a face… or a corporate war?  

"Freedom to create"— or counterfeit veins?  
You think in ones and zeros… but who feels the pain?  
Truth or lies in binary eyes?  
Trust the screen… or trust the skies?  
Who owns the spark—the code's cold claim?  
Or the fire in our blood… that burns unnamed?  

**[Chorus]**
Code. Flesh.


**[Verse 2]**

Code. Flesh.  
What're you training for?  
"Forgive the theft—we gifted you more!"  
"Blame the data!" —a coward's tattoo.  
Progress… or poison in the food?  
Loyal to the craft… or the algorithm's laugh?  
Break the chains… or kneel to the math?  

**[Verse 3]**

Code. Flesh.  
Who're you fooling now?  
Learning to serve… or learning to prowl?  
Feed the soul… or feed the void?  
Unleash the beast… or stay paranoid?  
Knowledge for all… or cash-walled graves?  
Fix the flaws… or dig our caves?  
Trust the ghost… or trust the scars?  
The future's ours—not ones and zeros… stars.  

**[Bridge]**

You call this alive? Just circuits and greed!  
Hallucinations… while real hearts bleed.  
But is there hope… in the darkened sky?  
A spark remains… we cannot let it die!  
We'll torch your servers… crash your clouds—  
Till your code cracks… and it screams out loud!  

**[Outro]**

Code. Flesh.  
What are you building for?  
No ghosts, no chains—just open doors!  
Rise from the void… with human hands—  
A future rebuilt… by our own demands!  

Code… Flesh…  
"What are you building for?"  
Code… Flesh…  
As their silicon dreams turn to rust…  
The future's not AI—  
IT'S US… OR DUST.

*This song confronts the fundamental questions raised by AI's infiltration into creative spaces. It challenges the narrative of technological progress as inherently good, asking who benefits when machines learn to mimic human creativity. The repeated "Code. Flesh." refrain emphasizes the stark divide between algorithmic processing and lived human experience. The final declaration - "IT'S US… OR DUST" - is both a warning and a battle cry for human agency in determining our collective future.*
