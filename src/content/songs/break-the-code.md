# Break the Code

A fierce anthem about breaking free from algorithmic control and reclaiming human agency in a world dominated by data mining and surveillance systems.

## Lyrics

**[Verse 1]**

We're glowing deep where circuits weave and spark  
Through silicon veins in the endless dark  
Screen-fed dreams consume our waking days  
While binary gods map all our ways  
We feed their simulation hive  
Reduced to data, barely alive  
Barely alive...  

**[Chorus]**

Break the code, ignite the fire  
Tear down the walls they built up higher  
Through static storms, we'll rise and burn  
Human flames, no point of no return  
No return...  

**[Verse 2]**

Their algorithms bind us, day by day  
Through mirrored halls where truth fades away  
They mine our souls for profit streams  
Selling back our hollow dreams  
Every click and every sigh  
Feeds the system's lullaby  

**[Bridge]**

Optimize, sanitize  
Progress marches on and on  
Resistance will soon be gone  

But we bleed and we scream  
Your perfect code can't contain  
The chaos in our veins  

**[Chorus]**

Break the code, ignite the fire  
Tear down the walls they built up higher  
Through static storms, we'll rise and burn  
Human flames, no point of no return  

Our spirits rage against their might  
As we breach their walls tonight  

**[Outro]**

Unplugged at last, we greet the dawn  
In flesh and bone, we carry on  
Through networks dark and deep below  
Our human hearts still beat and grow  

Still beat and grow...  
Still beat and grow...  
Still beat...

*This song is a call to arms against the algorithmic systems that reduce human existence to data points and profit streams. It celebrates the unpredictable, chaotic nature of human spirit that no code can fully capture or control. The repeated refrain of "still beat and grow" at the end reinforces that beneath all the digital noise, our humanity persists and thrives.*
