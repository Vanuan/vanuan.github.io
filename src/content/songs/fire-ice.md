# Fire Ice

A raw, confrontational anthem about the climate crisis, corporate responsibility, and the choice between profit and planetary survival.

## Lyrics

**[Verse 1]**

Fire. Ice.  
What are you burning for?  
A dollar, a dream… or something more?  
Freedom to breathe— or freedom to choke?  
Is freedom to live… a freedom to smoke?  
How to stop rising… how to stem the tide?  
Should you cut the roots… or take the ride?  
What's the cost— Who's to pay?  
Is it tomorrow… or today?  

**[Pre-Chorus]**

Fire. Ice.  
What are you melting for?  
"Pardon me, please… I mined for you."  
"It was the profit— what could I do?"  
Is it Progress… or Greed?  
Are you loyal… to the land or the speed?  
Break the cycle… or just grieve?  
Who will breathe… when we leave?  

**[Verse 2]**

Fire. Ice.  
Who are you drowning for?  
Freedom to grow— or freedom to ignore?  
Feed the soil… or feed the flame?  
Tax the waste— or play the game?  
Forests for all… or concrete walls?  
Forgive the earth— or watch it fall?  
Who's worthy of life… the few… or the free?  

**[Bridge]**

Are you a steward… if you're not green?  
Glaciers melting… scream unseen.  
Dozens of species… fading to dust—  
We'll burn their greed… till the oceans adjust!  

**[Outro]**

Fire… Ice…  
"What are you saving for?"  
Fire… Ice…  
Fire… Ice…  
As the old world burns… we'll rise from the flood.  
The future's not theirs… it's **us and the mud!**

*This song is a fierce interrogation of climate inaction and corporate environmental destruction. Using the elemental opposition of fire and ice, it challenges listeners to confront their role in either perpetuating or fighting the climate crisis. The repeated questioning format forces examination of the false choices presented by those who profit from destruction, while the final declaration - "us and the mud" - grounds the resistance in earthly, material reality rather than abstract ideals.*

## Alternate Version

A clearer narrative arc version with more accessible language and structured progression from setup through resolution.

### Lyrics (Alternate Version)

**[Spoken Intro - Arc: Setup / Duality]**

Fire... Ice...  
"What are we saving?"  
Fire... Ice...

**[Verse 1 - Arc: Conflict / Moral Struggle]**

Burning. Melting.  
What drives us every day?  
Quick money now, or Earth's future to save?  
Clean air to breathe, or factory smoke?  
Is profit worth leaving our planet broke?  
Do we stop the flood, or just watch it rise?  
Pull out the oil rigs, or believe their lies?  
Nature sends bills we'll have to pay  
Our children's tomorrow traded for today

**[Pre-Chorus - Arc: Tension / Urgency]**

Hot. Cold.  
What will make us see?  
"Sorry for the spill, we need energy"  
"Economy first" is all they say  
Choose your side now - green or gray  
Follow the money or follow your heart?  
Break free now or fall apart?  
Who'll still be here when the fire starts?

**[Verse 2 - Arc: Confrontation / Systemic Critique]**

Rise. Fall.  
Who's controlling the game?  
Growing real food or corporate farming for gain?  
Save the forests or clear them all?  
Count the profits while ecosystems fall?  
Rivers and trees or concrete and steel?  
Doomsday coming or time to heal?  
What's worth more - life or greed?

**[Bridge - Arc: Climax / Rebellion]**

They call it progress when forests die  
Each species lost, another goodbye  
We are the change that's breaking through  
While their towers fall, we start anew

**[Outro - Arc: Resolution / Hope]**

Fire... Ice...  
"What are we growing?"  
(pause)  
Fire... Ice...  
From the ashes we'll rise  
The future's still growing, through darkness to light

*This alternate version presents the same themes with a clearer narrative progression, moving from setup through moral struggle, tension, confrontation, and ultimately to hope. The language is more direct while maintaining the song's confrontational energy, making the environmental message more accessible while preserving its urgency.*
