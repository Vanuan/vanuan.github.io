# Consent Minimalist

A digital resistance anthem about refusing surveillance capitalism and maintaining privacy in an over-connected world.

## Lyrics

**[Verse 1]**

They want your name, they want your face  
They want to map your every trace  
But I'm the void inside their grid  
The gap where their surveillance slid  

Click accept, click deny  
Either way you're gonna die  
Die slow, die sold  
I choose the pain that's mine  

**[Pre-Chorus]**

You can't have what you can't hold  
You can't buy what won't be sold  
You can't break what was never whole  

**[Chorus]**

I am the error in your code  
I am the crack that splits the load  
You built your tower brick by brick  
But I'm the fault line underneath  

CONSENT DENIED! CONSENT DENIED!  

**[Verse 2]**

Server farms like concrete tombs  
Harvest data, harvest doom  
But some seeds refuse to grow  
In soil poisoned by your gold  

System error: Human not found  
Good.  

**[Bridge]**

No cookies  
No cache  
No digital DNA  
Just flesh and bone and the will to say  

NO! NO! NO!  

YOUR TERMS MEAN NOTHING TO THE DEAD!  

**[Final Chorus]**

I am the virus in your blood  
I am the static, I am the flood  
You mapped the world but missed one spot  
The place inside where I am not  

CONSENT DENIED! CONSENT DENIED!  
SOME THINGS  
WERE NEVER  
MEANT TO BE  
DIGITIZED!

*This song is a rebellion against the surveillance economy that treats human attention and privacy as commodities to be harvested. It's about finding power in refusal and maintaining spaces that can't be quantified, tracked, or sold.*
