# Forever Young Forever Broke

A scathing critique of Silicon Valley's pivot from crypto and AI hype to longevity technology, exposing how each new tech revolution becomes another way to extract wealth from the desperate masses.

## Lyrics

**[Verse 1 - Aggressive, sneering - The Endless Cycle]**

They sold us dot-com dreams, then web 2.0  
They sold us bailouts when the banks said "no"  
They sold us expensive anal probes  
They sold our eyeballs, then they sold our souls  
Social networks turned us into lab rats  
Crypto made us broke but feeling fat  
Short form clips have rotted our brains  
AI will surely save us, heal our pains!  

**[Verse 2 - Extended with same rhythmic pattern]**

Now genetic cure will save the day  
Stem cell injections cure decay  
They're printing tissue, growing hearts  
Artificial doctors with all the smarts  
"Upload your mind!" they promise there  
Digital heaven, if you dare  
Same damn cycle, same damn crew  
New buzzwords but the grift stays true  

**[Chorus - Sarcastic anthem]**

WE'RE ALL GONNA LIVE FOREVER!  
Just sign this terms of service, whatever!  
Aging's just disrupted, can't you see?  
From those who backed Theranos and NFT!  
FOREVER YOUNG! FOREVER BROKE!  
What a cosmic joke!  

**[Bridge - Breakdown, building to explosion]**

THEY SOLD US BITCOIN!  
THEY SOLD US THE CLOUD!  
NOW THEY'RE SELLING FOREVER  
TO THE RICH CROWD!  
AI reads your genes like a crystal ball  
"Turn back the clock!" they promise us all  
They're growing new hearts in fancy labs  
While we can't afford our medicine tabs!  

**[Final Chorus - Pure rage]**

OH WE'RE GONNA LIVE FOREVER (pause) IN DEBT!  
This is totally not a scam, you bet!  
Just trust the corporation's word  
Our R&D has never been absurd!  
FOREVER YOUNG FOR THE 1%!  
THE REST OF US? IRRELEVANT!  
WHAT A COSMIC JOKE!

*This song traces the tech industry's evolution of empty promises - from dot-com riches to web 2.0 democratization, from crypto wealth to AI salvation, and now to the ultimate grift: selling immortality itself. Each verse catalogs how Silicon Valley repackages hope and sells it back to us, while the wealthy actually benefit from the technologies we fund through our data, attention, and desperation. The repeated "cosmic joke" reminds us that the promise of transcending human limitations always comes with fine print that excludes most of humanity.*
