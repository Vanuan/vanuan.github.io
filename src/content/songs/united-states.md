# U[nited]S[tates]

A politically charged anthem questioning the divisions in American society and the choices between freedom and control, left and right, unity and division.

## Lyrics

**[Intro]**

Left. Right.  
What are you voting for?  
Safety net or total control?  

**[Verse 1]**

Freedom of speech - is it freedom to lie?  
Is freedom of press… a freedom to hide?  
How to prove absence… how to tell truth?  
Should you ban lies… or just disprove?  
What's fake news - Who to believe?  
Is it war… or peace?  

**[Pre-Chorus]**

Left. Right.  
What are you standing for?  
Rise of a king or the republican fall.  

**[Verse 2]**

"Pardon me, please… I covered for you."  
"It was the order—how could I refuse?"  
Is it Kingdom… or Republic?  
Are you loyal… to wealth or the public?  
Blow the whistle… or just leave?  
Who will protect… after the fall of the king?  

**[Chorus]**

Left. Right.  
Who are you fighting for?  
Should there be a center or should you be foes.  

**[Verse 3]**

Is Freedom to carry—a freedom to shoot?  
Help the sick… or care only for you?  
Tax the rich—or punish the poor?  
Schools for masses… or Ivy walls?  
Forgive their debts—or tax rich halls?  
Who's worthy of help… the king… or the pawns?

**[Bridge]**

Are you a citizen… if you're not white?  
Immigrant laws… reek of spite.  
Dozens of wounds… ripped open by hate—  
But we'll burn their divide… with the fire inside!  

**[Outro]**

Left… Right…  
"What are you fighting for?"  
Left… Right…  
Left… Right…  
As the old world cracks… we'll forge a new design.  
The future's ours… to realign!

*This song confronts the polarized state of American politics, questioning the binary choices that dominate public discourse. It challenges listeners to look beyond left-right divisions and consider what principles truly matter in a democracy. The bracketed letters in the title - U[nited]S[tates] - suggest both unity and separation, reflecting the nation's internal contradictions.*
