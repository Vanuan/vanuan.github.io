There's something strange about putting your thoughts out there for everyone to see. Even before anyone follows you, just knowing your words could be read by anyone changes how you think and write - like watching yourself in a mirror and suddenly becoming aware of every movement. Maybe that's just anxiety talking, or maybe it's that universal human shyness of being truly seen. But then when you do get followers, you don't just gain an audience - you gain a kind of responsibility you never asked for. You start becoming this avatar of people's collective thoughts and feelings, losing pieces of yourself along the way. It's like your followers project their own thoughts onto you, fighting for influence over who you become, similar to how neurons compete for dominance in a brain. You're no longer just yourself - you're something bigger, filtering your thoughts and reacting to others. And here's the weird part: between creators and consumers, who really has the power? Any reputation can be canceled and crushed overnight. When people look up to you while you're secretly wishing you could hide away, it changes you. Are you still even a person, or have you become public property? Maybe that's why even though it's easier than ever to create content, fewer people actually want to. Nobody wants to grow up and carry that weight.
