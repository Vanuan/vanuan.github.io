## Dell XPS 12 Ubuntu experience

Recently I bought Dell XP12 convertible ultrabook. Though it worked pretty well in Windows, there are some issues with using it in Linux, namely Ubuntu GNOME 14.04.

### No virtual keyboard

It's impossible to use it in tablet mode out of the box. The built in keyboard (Screen Keyboard in accessability menu) doesn't show up automatically when touching input fields. Moreover, it doesn't support non-english layouts.

Status: [work in progress](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShell/Design/Whiteboards/ScreenKeyboard)

### No touch screen autorotate

### Strange touch screen behavour


### No context menu keyboard button
