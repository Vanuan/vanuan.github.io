title: Interface and abstract class in C++
---

	What is the difference between interface and abstract class in C++?


	Quote from [C++ Programming/Classes/Abstract Classes / Wikibooks](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Classes/Abstract_Classes):


<blockquote><p>&amp;#8220;An abstract class is, conceptually, a class that cannot be instantiated and is usually implemented as a class that has one or more pure virtual (abstract) functions.

&amp;#8230;

The concept of interface is mapped to pure abstract classes in C++, as there is no construction &amp;#8220;interface&amp;#8221; in C++ the same way that there is in Java.&amp;#8221;</p></blockquote>

	So, interface in Java is a pure abstract class in C++.
