## SNP Analysis

So, you already know what SNP is. How does it affect your body? There's no simple answer. Although, there are thousands of people with full genome sequenced and many more with SNP data, there are only a handfull of SNP markers we are sure about what they do.

## The data

There are a lot of people who decided to publich their raw 23andme data:

* https://github.com/dbolser/genotyping_23andme
* https://github.com/orta/dna
* https://github.com/soffes/dna
* https://github.com/lstoll/dna
* https://github.com/clee/dna
* https://github.com/ruudkoot/dna
* https://github.com/bfoz/dna
* https://github.com/trevor/dna/tree/master/23andme
* https://github.com/adelcambre/dna
* https://github.com/jasongill/dna
* https://github.com/kennethreitz/genome

Even more are listed on [SNPedia](http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Genomes) and [opensnp](http://opensnp.org/).

Read Manu Sporny's [blog post](http://manu.sporny.org/2011/public-domain-genome/).

Unfortunately, the SNP data itself means nothing without phenotypes and conditions.

Fortunately, there is an [initiative](http://www.nature.com/news/geneticists-push-for-global-data-sharing-1.13133) to create exactly that &mdash; the large database of genetic information with relation to clinical information.

For now, the most complete database of SNP linkage with medical conditions is [SNPedia](http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/SNPedia).

## Analysis tools

There are a bunch of tool that intend to help to understand your genome.
