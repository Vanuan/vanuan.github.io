        <div class="prose dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
                My software engineering journey began in industrial automation,
                writing assembly code for Atmel microcontrollers to control
                rotor balancing machines. This hands-on experience taught me the
                thrill of seeing code directly manipulate physical machinery,
                like balancing massive train wheel axles.
            </p>

            <p>
                Discovering Stack Overflow, Git, and GitHub was transformative,
                revealing the power of collaborative problem-solving and
                open-source development. These platforms became invaluable
                resources for learning and growth. My fascination with SWEBOK
                (Software Engineering Body of Knowledge) deepened my
                understanding of software engineering principles, though I later
                realized real-world development often demands flexibility beyond
                any single framework.

                After graduation, I developed NPAPI browser plugins in C++ for
                BMW and Mercedes infotainment systems. Debugging on shared
                hardware prototypes without traditional inputs pushed me to
                deploy emulation solutions and platform-dependent code combined
                with unit testing. This period also introduced me to CI/CD with
                Jenkins, version control systems, and the importance of
                teamwork.
            </p>

            <p>
                My programming journey evolved through C++, Jython, Python 2,
                Ruby on Rails, and JavaScript, shaping my full-stack development
                skills. Docker and CI/CD practices revolutionized my approach to
                deployment, while React and TypeScript transformed my frontend
                development perspective. A brief return to Python allowed me to
                apply years of accumulated wisdom.
            </p>

            <p>
                From assembly code controlling machinery to modern web
                applications, each phase of my career has taught me valuable
                lessons. Recent industry shifts, including layoffs and AI
                advancements, have prompted me to think beyond technology,
                focusing more on business outcomes and the future of work.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today, I continue to grow as a developer, driven by the
                ever-changing nature of the field. The challenges of hardware
                constraints, the collaborative spirit of open source, and the
                structured principles of software engineering guide my work. The
                constant evolution of technology keeps the field exciting, with
                endless opportunities to learn and solve problems in better
                ways.
